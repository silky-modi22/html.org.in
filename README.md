Well, this is a really very good question. For that, you need to copy this code:

```html
<div class="video__plyr">
    <video id="player" playsinline controls cross-origin data-poster="/path/to/poster.jpg">
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 360.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="360" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 540.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="576" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 720.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="720" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/codes - 1080.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="1080" />
    </video>
</div>
```

For more information, please look into the `copy.html` file.
